# Crypto Clicker
A cookie clicker like game based on the life of your average crypto miner. I've rebuilt it with Redux to better handle state management and also fixed some of the issues the other version had. I tried to make it possible to mine several different coins but that proved to be quite the challenge so currently Bitcoin is the only coin you can mine. I also decided to remove real time pricing as that made the game very unbalanced depending on how the market was doing.

This game is by no means realistic what so ever. I know the bare minimum about cryptocurrency mining and this was just a fun side project.
